# Handoff

## Current goal
Reset repo to commit bfa1f97 per request.

## Decisions
Used git reset --hard to move HEAD back to bfa1f97.

## Changes since last session
- Reset HEAD to bfa1f97 (removed later commits locally).

## Verification status
repo_verify: OK (no changes; skipping).

## Risks
History was rewritten locally; remote may need force-push or coordination.

## Next actions
Confirm whether you want me to force-push the reset to the remote (if applicable).
